This file contains the official list of human TF motifs from Lambert et al (PMID:29425488), 
along with associated information.  You probably obtained it from the website accompanying
that study (http://humantfs.ccbr.utoronto.ca/download.php). Motifs were largely obtained 
from the Cis-BP web server (http://cisbp.ccbr.utoronto.ca/).  Both directly experimentally 
established motifs ("Direct") and motifs inferred from related TFs ("Inferred") are included.  
Details on how the inferences are performed are available in Weirauch et al (PMID:25215497).

At the time of publication of the human TF review, data were obtained from a new build
of Cis-BP that was still under development (build 1.94d).  This build will eventually
form the basis for Cis-BP public build 2.0, along with the addition of further motifs.
This file thus currently represents the latest list of available motifs, but it will 
become obsolete with future builds of Cis-BP (especially for builds after 2.0).

Questions and comments can be directed to

Database fields:

Ensembl ID - Official Ensembl gene ID.

HGNC symbol - Official gene name.

Motif evidence - Was the motif directly determined experimentally, or inferred from 
	experimental data from a related TF?  For inferred motifs, the name and species
	of the TF from which the motif was inferred are listed, along with the percent
	amino acid identity of the protein's DNA binding domain.  See Weirauch et al
	for details on the motif inferences.

Motif ID - Motif ID from the original data source.

Motif type - Type of data that produced the motif.  This can be experiment type (e.g., PBM
	or HT-SELEX) or another database (e.g., JASPAR or Transfac).

Motif source - Source of the data.  Most are in the format of Author/Year.

CIS-BP ID - ID from the Cis-BP motif database, build 1.94d.

Best Motif(s)? (Figure 2A) - Was the motif chosen as the "best motif" for the TF (see 
	Lambert et al for details).
